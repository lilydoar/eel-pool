- **Strong Foundation**: Establish scalable architecture for future game development

## User Stories

### As a Game Developer (Primary User)

**Development Workflow Stories:**
- As a developer, I want to modify game logic without restarting the application so that I can iterate quickly on gameplay mechanics
- As a developer, I want to reload data files (stats, behaviors, config) without recompilation so that I can tweak values in real-time
- As a developer, I want to record and replay game sessions so that I can test specific scenarios repeatedly
- As a developer, I want to combine hot reloading with game looping so that I can rapidly prototype and tune gameplay values
- As a developer, I want responsive input handling even during heavy game processing so that debugging remains smooth

**Runtime Experience Stories:**
- As a developer, I want consistent frame rates regardless of game logic complexity so that visual feedback is reliable
- As a developer, I want audio to remain synchronized and glitch-free during hot reloads so that audio-dependent gameplay isn't disrupted
- As a developer, I want clear separation between application, game, and rendering concerns so that I can modify each independently

### As a Player (Secondary User - Future Consideration)

**Gameplay Experience Stories:**
- As a player, I want smooth, responsive gameplay with consistent performance
- As a player, I want synchronized audio that enhances the game experience
- As a player, I want the game to load and run reliably across different scenarios

- Handle OpenGL resource management (textures, buffers, shaders)

**Sound Thread (Audio):**
- Read most recent audio packet from game thread buffer
- Process audio events (start/stop/modify sounds)
- Handle audio mixing, volume control, and channel management
- Use SDL3 audio subsystem for hardware audio output
- Ensure audio remains synchronized during hot reloads
- Manage audio resource lifecycle

**Job System (Worker Threads):**

- Process level loading/unloading requests
- Execute game save/load operations
- Perform long-running calculations (terrain generation, pathfinding, AI planning)
- Built on Odin's core:thread:Pool for robust thread management
- Simple priority system: higher integer values = higher priority execution

### Hot Reloading Requirements

**Trigger-Based Hot Reloading:**
- Expose separate thread-safe triggers for data reload and code reload
- Support trigger activation via hotkey
- Support trigger activation via file watcher
- Decouple reload triggers from file monitoring for flexibility
- Coordinate reload operations across all affected threads

**Game Logic Hot Reloading:**
- Compile game update code as shared library when hot reload enabled (async job)
- Dynamically load new game logic during runtime
- Handle game state struct changes by restarting game portion (preserve application)
- Save level state before restart, auto-reload after game restart
- Fall back to compiled-in code when hot reload disabled
- Swap game update function after next game loop iteration completes

**Data Hot Reloading:**
- Read all JSON data from data directory (async job)
- Replace data structs after next game loop iteration completes
- Validate data integrity before applying changes
- Provide feedback on reload success/failure
- Load all game data (no selective reloading needed due to async execution)

**Game State Change Handling:**
- Detect incompatible game state struct changes during code reload
- Trigger game portion restart while keeping application running
- Preserve all serializable data within game state struct through restart cycle
- Automatically restore saved level after successful restart

### Development Tooling Requirements

**Game Looping System:**
- Record complete game state and input sequence
- Replay recorded sessions with identical behavior
- Integrate recording/replay with hot reloading workflow
- Support multiple recording slots for different scenarios

**Performance and Safety:**
- Thread-safe communication between all threads
- Graceful degradation when threads miss updates
- Consistent behavior regardless of timing variations
- Clear error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Constraints

- Target platform: Desktop (initial), with consideration for future platforms
- Graphics API: OpenGL (context created through SDL3)
- Platform API: SDL3 for windowing, events, sound, and OpenGL context management
- Programming Language: Odin with data files in structured format (JSON)
- Performance: Maintain 60+ FPS during development workflow
- Dependencies: Keep external dependencies minimal and well-documented

## Design Philosophy

**Game Thread Asset Interaction:**
- Game thread operates on pure functions with game state data
- Game thread uses asset IDs/references, not raw asset data (textures, audio files, models)
- Specialized threads (Render, Audio, Job System) handle raw asset loading and management
- Exception: Collision shapes tied to entity types (logical game data, not raw assets)
- This separation maintains game logic purity and enables clean hot reloading
