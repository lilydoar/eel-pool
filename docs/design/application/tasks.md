## Thread Architecture Foundation task list:

### Phase 1: Thread Structure Setup (High Priority)

[ ] 1. Implement Thread Coordinator - thread lifecycle management and creation
[ ] 2. Create Main Thread structure - SDL3 event loop with thread coordination
[ ] 3. Implement Game Thread - basic game loop structure and timing
[ ] 4. Create Render Thread - basic thread structure and frame timing
[ ] 5. Implement Audio Thread - basic thread structure and SDL3 audio setup
[ ] 6. Create thread shutdown coordination - graceful termination across all threads

### Phase 2: Inter-Thread Communication (High Priority)

[ ] 7. Design thread-safe communication data structures - Input Buffer, Render Packet Buffer, Audio Packet Buffer
[ ] 8. Design and implement Input Event Buffer - lock-free circular buffer with frame numbering
[ ] 9. Design and implement Render Packet Buffer - double/triple buffered structure for render data
[ ] 10. Design and implement Audio Packet Buffer - double buffered structure for audio events

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Medium Priority)

[ ] 11. Implement Control Message System - mutex-protected messaging for thread coordination
[ ] 12. Connect Game Thread input consumption to Input Event Buffer
[ ] 13. Connect Game Thread packet generation to Render and Audio buffers
[ ] 14. Implement basic error handling and thread health monitoring
[ ] 15. Add thread-safe logging infrastructure with per-thread buffers
[ ] 16. Integrate threading system with existing app structure and game API loading
[ ] 17. Test thread communication and verify frame-independent operation
