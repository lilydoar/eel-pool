## Gameplay Balance Requirements

### Combat Timing Requirements

**Attack System Balance:**
- Attack cooldowns that prevent mindless button mashing while maintaining flow
- Hit stun duration that provides satisfaction without making enemies helpless
- Player movement speed balanced against enemy capabilities
- Attack range and timing balance across different enemy types

**Real-Time Timing Mechanics:**

- Clear visual and audio telegraphing for timing-based threats
- Player reaction windows that reward skill without feeling unfair

### Difficulty Progression Requirements

**Enemy Scaling:**
- Progressive difficulty through enemy combinations rather than simple stat inflation
- Player learning curve that builds on previously mastered skills
- Failure states that encourage learning rather than frustration

### Engagement Requirements

**Combat Flow:**
- Combat encounters that last long enough to be satisfying but short enough to encourage replay
- Risk/reward balance in player decision making
- Variety in combat scenarios to maintain interest

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Requirements
- Target platform: Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Input: Keyboard and mouse primary, gamepad support desirable
- Performance target: 60+ FPS during typical combat scenarios

### Camera and Perspective Requirements
- Three-quarter view perspective: Environment rendered in angled top-down view, characters in side-view
- 2D collision detection and movement in world space despite perspective illusion
- Clear level design to minimize collision/occlusion ambiguity
- Consistent perspective scaling between characters and environment elements

**Collision Detection Approach:**
- Simple 2D collision detection using basic shapes (circles for characters, rectangles for level geometry)
- All game entities (player, enemies, projectiles, level objects) interact on single 2D gameplay plane
- Visual three-quarter perspective is purely aesthetic - collision logic remains straightforward 2D
- Follow established patterns from classic games using this camera style (Zelda: Link to the Past, Hyper Light Drifter)

### Development Constraints
- All gameplay behavior must be data-driven for hot reload compatibility
- Asset loading must support development iteration workflows
- Game state must be serializable for development recording/replay systems
- Memory usage must be compatible with multi-threaded application architecture

### Integration Constraints
- Combat system must integrate with existing application threading model
- Audio system must work with SDL3 audio thread architecture
- Rendering must work with WebGPU render thread through asset ID system
- Input handling must work with existing input buffer system

## Design Philosophy

### Core Design Principles
- **Immediate Feedback**: Every player action should produce clear, immediate response
- **Readable Combat**: Combat scenarios should be visually clear and spatially understandable
- **Iterative Refinement**: All systems designed for rapid tweaking and adjustment
- **Foundation First**: Build solid core mechanics before adding complexity

### Development Approach
- **Prototype Early**: Get basic combat loop working before adding polish
- **Data-Driven Everything**: No hardcoded values that might need adjustment during development
- **Hot Reload First**: Design all systems to work seamlessly with hot reload workflow
- **Minimize Art Dependency**: Gameplay should work with placeholder art initially

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Criteria
- Player can control character movement responsively

### Development Milestone Priority
- **Primary Goal**: Complete playable prototype with character controller, enemy behavior, combat mechanics, and test arena
- **Secondary Goals**: Difficulty pacing, story integration, environmental polish come after playable foundation is established

## Future Expansion Considerations

- Environmental interaction and hazards
- Power-ups or temporary abilities
- Multiple combat arenas or environments

### Architecture Considerations
- Combat system should support additional player abilities
