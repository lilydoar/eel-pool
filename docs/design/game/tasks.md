# Character Fighting Game Implementation Tasks

## Core Game Foundation

### Phase 0: Game of life

[ ] 1. Minimal GOL implementation. Draw white squares against a black background. Run the simulation at a controllable speed.

### Phase 1: Game Structure and Data
[ ] 1. Create core game state structures (player, world, timing)
[ ] 2. Implement entity system with generational IDs and fixed pools
[ ] 3. Create JSON data loading for game configuration
[ ] 4. Integrate with hot reload system (state serialization, data reload triggers)
[ ] 5. Create basic data schemas: player config, enemy types, combat parameters

### Phase 2: Basic Rendering and Movement
[ ] 6. Generate render packets for player positioning and basic shapes
[ ] 7. Implement player input processing and movement (8-direction, 2D space)
[ ] 8. Create basic 2D collision system (circles for entities, rectangles for level geometry)
[ ] 9. Add level boundaries and environmental obstacles
[ ] 10. Test character movement with visual feedback in three-quarter view

## Combat System

### Phase 3: Player Combat
[ ] 11. Implement player attack system (input handling, timing, cooldowns)
[ ] 12. Create weapon collision detection and hit registration
[ ] 13. Add damage calculation and health tracking systems
[ ] 14. Generate render packets for attack animations and visual effects
[ ] 15. Generate audio packets for attack sounds and hit feedback

### Phase 4: Enemy System
[ ] 16. Create enemy spawning and basic AI (idle, chase, attack, death states)
[ ] 17. Implement enemy health, damage reception, and hit stun mechanics
[ ] 18. Add enemy render packets for animations and state changes
[ ] 19. Create multiple enemy types with distinct movement and attack patterns
[ ] 20. Add timing-based enemy attacks (wind-ups, delayed attacks)

### Phase 5: Combat Environment
[ ] 21. Build test arena with level geometry and collision boundaries
[ ] 22. Add AOE attacks and ground-based danger zones with visual markers
[ ] 23. Implement projectile system for ranged combat
[ ] 24. Create environmental hazards and interactive objects

### Phase 6: Polish and Balance
[ ] 25. Implement visual effects for combat impact (particles, screen effects)
[ ] 26. Add character audio personality system (Animal Crossing-style)
[ ] 27. Create combat parameter tuning and balance testing
[ ] 28. Add multiple enemy encounter scenarios
[ ] 29. Implement game state recording/replay integration for development

## Playable Prototype Complete

**Success Criteria:**
- Responsive character movement with immediate visual feedback
- Satisfying attack system with clear hit detection and visual/audio feedback
- Enemies that react meaningfully to player attacks with visible responses
- Hot reload workflow functioning smoothly during active combat
- Multiple enemy encounters demonstrating scalable combat complexity

**Development Notes:**
- Use placeholder graphics initially, but ensure visual feedback from start
- Test hot reload integration continuously throughout development
- Each phase should produce immediately testable and visible functionality
- Prioritize game feel and responsive feedback over visual polish initially
