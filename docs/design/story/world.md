## The Dead Sea

Heavy steam punk style metallic machines.
- Spider walkers the size of apartment blocks crawl over large, craggy, terrain
- A not uncommon portion of the landscape is large fields of spider mech remains
  - These fields stretch on for many 10s of kilometers
  - They are common and large enough that they are a standard part of overland travel

## The Two countries: Anoshtka and Borvoldia

Each country

Fuelled by large scale farming and biohacking for material & fuel supplies.
- Bio rubber
- Bio fuel
  - Make it look heavy like coal and steam
  - But burn oil/gas to fuel large machines
- VAST fields of diverse farming operations
  - It has a strong organic aesthetic though
- All of this is grown back home to fuel the long war
- All of this large scale farming operations and bio resource gathering is part
  of an advanced war initiative which has fuelled a centuries long war across a
  dried ocean (now desert and industrial sites metal gathering) which makes up a
  large portion of the northern hemisphere.
- In this world, most resources required for construction of large scale industrial
  economies can be grown, or bioengineered, at surplus levels, they are
  efficient carbon gathering operations, as well as pollutant obsorber.
- The only things which cannot be manufactured at scale within the
  bioengineering systems are metallic materials, which are mined from
  the ground, and the machines which are used to mine them.
- Large scale things like boats, buildings, etc that are used within an
  industrial society still need to be made out of metal though. The bio
  engineering isn't like "everyone lives in a tree", its like heavy industrial,
  with bio material stuck on in place of wood, plastic, anything that is bio in
  nature is of surplus (food, water, etc), but the machines and everything else
  are also fuelled by this bioengineering.
- This is an industrialized society which never hit any bottlenecks in terms of
  how many mechs and large scale death machines they could construct because
  liquid fuel supplies were never a bottle neck. Massive numbers of "ship"
  transporting fuel/food/supplies across the dead sea. Large tanker operations.
- There has been a war going on between the two countries for multiple
  centuries. An entire half of the northern northern hemisphere is just a dried
  ocean, now desert. It is craggy rocky sharp and inhospitable. Scattered across
  this dead ocean are metal mining industrial operations the size of small cities.
  It is hard to build things out in the dead ocean, so most things are built up.
  But things have to be made of metal so they get very heavy as you build up.
- There are "roads" across the ocean. Tracks stamped by so many walkers, so many
  times, that the rock broke down. Rubble was crushed. Tracks were stamped.
  Eventually, along these paths treaded vehicles are common. They make use of
  treads as thick as cars and ferry stories tall stacks of cargo containers at a
  crawling pace along desert canyon roads. When treads break down or are in need
  of replacement, they are dropped on the side of the path and replacement
  treads are delivered. For this reason the tracks and entryways to industrial
  sites are littered with "walls" of old discarded treads. This is because rubber
  has never been the supply bottleneck the entire time in this long war.
- The spider walkers are mostly separate from the treaded vehicles that crawl
  along the treaded pathways. Many large spider mechs can traverse above the
  crags and crevices effectively enough that is is completely viable to travel
  across areas where roads cannot pass by way of giant spider mech that is
  effectively an airship in style. Sometimes it is even faster. Just walk/jump
  over a canyon that stops any treaded vehicle.
- Spiders do travel slightly faster by road though.
- In a terrain where roads are difficult to make they are very valuable when two
  nations have been fighting over a fixed/known set of resource deposits/sources
  of metals, etc. This has resulted in large scale battles that result in ship
  graveyards the size of mountains.
- I keep saying ship because the aesthetic of the spider mechs and even treaded
  vehicles is that of battleships. This is a dead ocean, in world aesthetic. It
  is a large, dry, rocky, poisoned, inhospitable, desert.
- This ocean was extremely deep. But it also has/had large islands in chains
  across it. These have erorded and changed, but now make up mountain communities.
  Some loyal to/part of Anoshtka or Borvoldia, but also other countries, both
  smaller, but more varied in their history and culture. These are countries
  because they have a small amount of "sea level" land and true mountain land that
  is above sea level. This is valuable because it is required to do large scale
  bio engineering. The displacement of so much water across the globe required gas
  volume to fill it. A not insignificant portion of this was heavy pollutants
  which naturally settle into the empty ocean layer. It helps that a majority of
  the pollutants were originally produced near, or in, the dead ocean zone.
- This has resulted in a hemisphere where the two countries are on relatively
  livable and treasured pieces of land, but this vast gulf of desecrated, poisoned
  land lays between them. In the dead ocean depth matters a lot because of how
  heavy the pollutant layers are at deep points. Things get more dangerous/weird
  the lower you go.
