## Project Overview

Read the @README.md file to understand project context and setup instructions

## Communication Guidelines

- When completing a task, write a short final response instead of a long final response unless asked for a report or something similar.
- Do not jump to conclusions when working through chains of analysis. Anywhere you could be missing context, or not seeing the larger picture, stop and ask clarifying questions such as information about details, decisions, or where to look to find the information you require
