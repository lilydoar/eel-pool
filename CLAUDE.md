# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Odin-based graphics application using SDL3 for window management.

## Build System

The project uses a custom Odin build script:

- **Build and run**: `odin run build.odin -file -- run`
- **Build only**: `odin run build.odin -file` (without "run" argument)

## Communication Guidelines

- When completing a task, write a short final response instead of a long final response unless asked for a report or something similar.
- Do not jump to conclusions when working through chains of analysis. Anywhere you could be missing context, or not seeing the larger picture, stop and ask clarifying questions such as information about details, decisions, or where to look to find the information you require

## Documentation Tasks

- Read the README.md file to understand project context and setup instructions
